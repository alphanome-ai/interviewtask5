## Interview Assignment: Blog-to-Video Automation Pipeline

## Overview
This is a screening assignment for our developer position. The task involves building an automated pipeline that converts blog posts from our knowledge hub into engaging video content using AI technologies and automation workflows.

## Background
Content repurposing is crucial for modern digital marketing, but manually converting blog posts into videos is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This assignment focuses on building an automated system that can transform written content into professional video presentations while maintaining the educational value and brand consistency.

## Task Description
Build an automated pipeline using Python that converts blog posts from Alphanome's knowledge hub into video content. The system should handle text processing, script generation, visual asset creation, and final video composition with appropriate transitions and branding.

The output should be similar to educational finance videos seen on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube.

## Source Content
- Access to Alphanome's knowledge hub blog posts at https://www.alphanome.ai/knowledgehub
- Focus on financial technology and market analysis content
- Consider both technical and narrative elements of the content

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
* Extract and process blog post content programmatically
* Generate optimized video scripts from blog content
* Create dynamic visual assets (charts, graphs, text overlays)
* Implement text-to-speech with natural-sounding voices
* Automate video composition with transitions
* Apply consistent branding elements
* Generate appropriate video thumbnails

### Technical Specifications
* Use Python as the primary language
* Implement content extraction and processing pipeline
* Integrate with text-to-speech APIs
* Use video composition libraries (e.g., MoviePy, OpenCV)
* Create automated visual asset generation
* Include progress monitoring and error handling
* Build modular components for each stage of the pipeline

### Quality Standards
* Write maintainable, documented code
* Include comprehensive type hints
* Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
* Implement proper logging and monitoring
* Document each pipeline component
* Include unit tests for critical components

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Implementation (35%)
* Code quality and organization
* Content processing accuracy
* Pipeline automation effectiveness
* Error handling and recovery
* Resource management
* Testing coverage

### Video Quality (25%)
* Visual appeal and professionalism
* Audio clarity and synchronization
* Transition smoothness
* Branding consistency
* Overall production value

### Content Adaptation (25%)
* Script generation quality
* Visual asset relevance
* Key message retention
* Audience engagement potential
* Content flow and pacing

### Performance and Scalability (15%)
* Processing time optimization
* Resource usage efficiency
* Parallel processing implementation
* API usage optimization
* Storage management

## Submission Guidelines

### Required Files
Your submission should be a ZIP file containing:
* Complete source code of the pipeline
* README.md with:
   * Setup instructions
   * API configuration steps
   * Pipeline execution guide
   * Component documentation
   * Performance optimization notes
* Requirements.txt or similar dependency file
* Sample output videos (2-3 examples)
* Testing scripts and documentation

### Submission Process
Send your submission as a compressed ZIP file to info@alphanome.ai

## Important Notes
* Implement appropriate rate limiting for all APIs
* Include error handling for each pipeline stage
* Document assumptions about blog post structure
* Consider implementing caching mechanisms
* Focus on maintainability and scalability

## Time Expectation
* The assignment should take approximately **5-10 days** to complete
* **Focus on core functionality first**, then add improvements if time permits
